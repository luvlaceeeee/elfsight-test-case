## Philosophy

This template was created exclusively for quick deployment of the project, with all the necessary dependencies for collaborative and single development.

It solves the problem I faced myself, which is that there is no exact source in the public domain, where you will be explained how and what to put correctly in order to comfortably develop applications. 

There are different approaches everywhere, different dependencies, which cause a stir to those who first encounter them.

I'm not very experienced myself and it's quite possible this template is garbage, but I like it now and will use it in my projects until I realize that it needs to be changed.
